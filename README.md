# snn-alpha-synaptic

The base of the code is my thesis work on the alpha synaptic function which invented by Google Research.

The thesis focused on reimplementing the code by Google Research and make it GPU trainable with the help of PyTorch and PyTorch tensors. The code is avoiding cycles where possible during neural network feed-forward and backward operations.

Since then I rewrote few things, mostly reorganized in a more better structure.

The code is still work in progress.
